        Originally from Chicago and was forced to move to Texas when I was 5. Lived in South Texas until I graduated High School and decided to go to college at The University of Texas
    </p>

    <p> Graduated from UT in 2011 and have been in Account Management/Marketing roles since. While I have usually always liked my jobs, I do not like how un-flexible they are. I would like a career that allows me to be creative and gives me the flexibility to travel and work from home which is why I would like to be a Web Developer! </p>
